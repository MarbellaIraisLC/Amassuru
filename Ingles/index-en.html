<h1>Who are we?</h1>
  </div>
We are a network of women working on security and defense issues in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The network was created to promote the work of women in these areas, as well as to facilitate their visibility and promote discussion spaces in the region.
<br>
Together we are more powerful. This is the reason why we believe that creating a network in an area from which we have been historically excluded is critical. We are an independent, nonpartisan network of women working in a variety of sectors, including research, teaching, public policy and prevention, journalism, non-governmental organizations, national and local governments, as well as international organizations and academia, among other sectors. The Amassuru network focuses on security from a broad perspective, including citizen security, human security, international security and justice.</div>

<p style="background:#368275; color:white;  padding:25px;  text-align:center; font-size:15px;">The word 'Amassuru' comes from the Tupi language and refers to 'The Amazon Women'. These are the strong and brave women found by the Spanish when they arrived to Latin America and the Caribbean. According to some historians, the word Amazon derives from Tupi Amassuru, which wants to say "resounding waters".</p>

<summary style="background:#fff; color:#368275;    margin-left: 5%;  margin-right: 5%; padding:25px;  text-align:justify; font-size:20px;">What do we want to achieve?</summary>

<div style="background:#fff;  margin-left: 5%;  margin-right: 5%; text-align:justify; font-size:15px;">   
  <p>
      Our main objective is to provide visibility and to promote women’s work in an area historically dominated by men. We believe that working within a network is crucial to enhance each other’s qualities as well as paving the way for and creating new opportunities for a younger generation of women. 

Our idea is to establish a space for discussion and knowledge creation in different areas related to security. The work that we are currently developing will make itself visible through the network, and we also wish to create instances in which we can participate collectively. We consider that women experience security risks and conflicts in a differentiated manner. This implies that we can make contributions to the way in which public policy is addressed to promote security and solve conflicts in the region. It is for this reason that we consider the creation of a network to be of vital importance to identify the working areas and the spaces where the active participation of women is required.
</p>
<p>With this objective, we find it necessary to:</p>

<li>Generate a network through the creation of a directory of women experts in security in Latin America and the Caribbean.</li>
<li>Make visible the work and the initiatives of women in the area of security in the region.</li>
<li>Incorporate women’s voices in all discussion spaces related to security, which have been historically dominated by men.</li>
<li>Enhance the individual capacities of network participants.</li>
<li>Create new synergies and collective efforts, including the establishment of alliances with other organizations, media outlets and academic institutions.</li>

<summary style="background:#fff; color:#368275;    margin-left: 5%;  margin-right: 5%; padding:25px;  text-align:justify; font-size:20px;">Where are we going?</summary>
<div style="background:#fff;  margin-left: 5%;  margin-right: 5%; text-align:justify; font-size:15px;">   
  <p>Once established, we will work to create discussion spaces within the network, including forums and publication, among other initiatives.

In the medium and long term, the objective is to substantiate a gender perspective towards the issues of crime, violence and conflict resolution. We pursue this objective not only because of the particular way that we experience crime, violence and conflict, but also based on our tools to address them. We will be able to define those tools and apply them at the local, national and in international conflicts as well.</p>

  <li>Independence: This organization is apolitical and nonpartisan. </li>

 <li>Gender perspective: Women experience violence and insecurity different from men. For this reason, a gender perspective is necessary in the analysis and solutions to security problems.  </li>

 <li>Solidarity and teamwork: Working as part of a network is the central element for individual and collective development and growth. </li>

 <li>Transparency: Amassuru’s work objectives will remain those stated in this document. Therefore, we will never use any collected data for other means, either commercial or academic.   </li>
